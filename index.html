                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Izzoe A/L Syaris Octavian. I was born on 27th September 2006. I was born in Putrajaya and lived in Selangor.
                    My house is in the southwest section of Dengkil, where it is close to Banting, and I am not married.
                    I work as a student for the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Diploma in Computer Science, and I get home every day by 6PM at the latest.
                    I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink (tea). I'm in bed by 11PM, and make sure I get six hours of sleep, no matter what.
                    After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.
                    Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
                    I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
                    I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
                    That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to compete I wouldn't lose to anyone.
